### 1. How many samples does the test data set include?
The test dataset includes **1 sample**.

### 2. Which version of bclconvert was used to perform the demultiplexing?
 
In my run, the **bclconvert version was 4.3.6**.

The bclconvert version used is reported in the `nf_core_pipeline_software_mqc_versions.yml` file generated by the pipeline. 

### 3. What was the exact bclconvert command used?

The bclconvert command is dynamically built within a Nextflow process block as follows:

```bash
bcl-convert \
    $args \
    --output-directory output \
    --bcl-input-directory ${input_dir} \
    --sample-sheet ${samplesheet}
```
Thw command was located at:
`/Users/alexandrapolukarova/.nextflow/assets/nf-core/demultiplex/modules/nf-core/bclconvert/main.nf`

### 4. How would you configure the pipeline to trim the fastqs?  
Fastp is integrated by default into the pipeline. This tool performs... Optionally, the user can provide adapter sequences through the Illumina sample sheets and include the `--remove_adapters` flag in the command line. This will... and  (Incluir una referencia de la doc).  

### 5. How would you configure the pipeline so that MultiQC is run with `--exclude fastp`? (This excludes the fastp section from the MultiQC report.) 

You can configure the pipeline to exclude the fastp module from the MultiQC report by using a custom MultiQC configuration file (see [MultiQC docs](https://docs.seqera.io/multiqc/reports/customisation#removing-modules-or-sections)).  

I created a file named `multiqc_config.yml` adding the following content:  

```yaml
exclude_modules:
  - "fastp"
```

And then I included the parameter `--multiqc_config` specifying the path to the custom MultiQC configuration file, then run the pipeline as follows:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/demultiplex \
    -profile test,docker -revision 1.5.4 \
    --multiqc_config /path/to/multiqc_config.yml \
    --outdir results  
```
Alternatively, you could modify the default `multiqc_config.yml` directly in the Nextflow assets directory and run the pipeline without using the `--multiqc_config` parameter:

`/Users/alexandrapolukarova/.nextflow/assets/nf-core/demultiplex/assets`
