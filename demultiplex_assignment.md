### 1. How many samples does the test data set include?
The test dataset includes **1 sample**.

### 2. Which version of bclconvert was used to perform the demultiplexing?
 
In my run, the **bclconvert version was 4.3.6**.

The bclconvert version used is reported in the `nf_core_pipeline_software_mqc_versions.yml` file generated by the pipeline. 

### 3. What was the exact bclconvert command used?

In the Nextflow process for bclconvert, the command executed was:  
*(Clarify any necessary arguments before running the command.)*

```bash
bcl-convert \
    $args \
    --output-directory output \
    --bcl-input-directory ${input_dir} \
    --sample-sheet ${samplesheet}
```

The main script containing the bclconvert command in my case was found in the main Nextflow folder containing the demultiplex modules following this path:

`/Users/alexandrapolukarova/.nextflow/assets/nf-core/demultiplex/modules/nf-core/bclconvert/main.nf`

### 4. How would you configure the pipeline to trim the fastqs?  
Fastp is integrated by default into the pipeline. This tool performs... Optionally, the user can provide adapter sequences through the Illumina sample sheets and include the `--remove_adapters` flag in the command line.  

### 5. How would you configure the pipeline so that MultiQC is run with `--exclude fastp`? (This excludes the fastp section from the MultiQC report.) 

You can configure the pipeline to exclude the fastp module from the MultiQC report by using a custom MultiQC configuration file.  

I created a file named `multiqc_config.yml` with the following content:  

```yaml
exclude_modules:
  - "fastp"
```

And then I would include the parameter `--multiqc_config </path/to/multiqc_config.yml> ` to run the pipeline as follows:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/demultiplex \
    -profile test,docker -revision 1.5.4 \
    --multiqc_config /path/to/multiqc_config.yaml \
    --input pipeline_samplesheet.csv \
    --outdir results
```
Another way would be to configure the original multiqc_config.yaml located in
